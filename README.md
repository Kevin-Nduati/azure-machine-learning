# azure-machine-learning
To make use of the current increase in the volume of data being generated globaly requires distributed systems, powerful algoritthms, and scalable cloud infrastructure to compute insights and train and deploy models. This repository contains notes and code as I try to improve my knowledge of building machine learning(ML) models using azure and end-to-end ML pipelines on the cloud.<br>
I intend to have mastered ML development and be able to confidently build and operate scalable ML pipelines in Azure.
